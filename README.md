# AiRope

## Description
The idea is pretty simple; you have a locally (with an OpenAI, Claude, etc. support) installed AI application that
helps you with:
1. **Work with documents**: save documents to the local database with tags, search, reminders, etc.
2. **Work with code**: [TODO, but, connect the folder, sync changes with AI, get realtime suggestions (like testing, for example)]
3. **RAG**, retrieval augment generation.
4. **Desktop UI** based on Tkinter.
